## Note App 

This app is to be used to keep a running tally of your notes.
Your note is re-written into yaml format and given headers
like `search_term:` , `glossary:` or `vim_tricks`

When the note is run by the script it will separate the info in those headers to separate 
pages which are named after them. These pages will aggregate over time once you continue to 
send more notes through.

You will end up with a search_term.txt page and a glossary.txt page and a vim_tricks.txt page
that will be individually formatted.
